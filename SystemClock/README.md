SystemClock is a mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) which adds a draggable, resizable, customizable clock to the game screen.

It includes 5 editable presets and supports a variety of time formats, UI styles, and color options.

Keep track of time - don't fall into the `Black Hole`.
