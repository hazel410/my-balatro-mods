# What is this?

This is the mod used in my video where I [play a hand of Balatro using every joker at once.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX_CXwpL_1U) Some people expressed interest in trying it themselves to see if they could better optimize the joker order.

# How do I install?

First, make sure you have Steamodded installed. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).

Once that's done, download this repository (Click the button labeled '<> Code' in the top right, then 'Download Zip'), and unzip the contents into your Mods folder (e.g. put the folder labeled AllJokersChallenge-jimbo into your mods folder).

# How do I play?

If all goes well, you should have a new challenge at the end of the challenges list, unlocked by default, called 'Everything All At Once'. Good luck!
